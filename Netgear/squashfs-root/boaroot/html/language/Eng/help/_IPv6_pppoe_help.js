For example, if your main mail account is JerAB@ISP.com, then put JerAB in this box.<p>Some ISPs (like Mindspring, Earthlink, and T-DSL) require that you use your full e-mail address when you log in. If your ISP requires your full e-mail address, then type it in the Login box.<p><b>Password</b><p>Type the password that you use to log in to your ISP.<p><b>Service Name</b><p>If your ISP provided a Service Name, enter it here. Otherwise, this may be left blank.<p><b>Connection Mode</b><p>This is the setting specifying when the router should establish the PPPoE connection. Currently the connection mode is always &quot;always on&quot; in order to provide a steady IPv6 connection. The router will never disconnect the connection, and in case the connection is broken (e.g. the cable/DSL modem is turned off somehow), the router will bring up the connection right after the PPPoE connection is available.<p><b>Router's IPv6 Address on WAN</b><p>This shows the IPv6 address acquired for the router's WAN (or Internet) interface. The number after the slash ('/') is the length of the prefix, which is also roughly indicated by the underline ('_') under the IPv6 address.<p><b>Router's IPv6 Address on LAN</b><p>This shows the IPv6 address acquired for the router's LAN interface. The number after the slash ('/') is the length of the prefix, which is also roughly indicated by the underline ('_') under the IPv6 address.<p><b>IP Address Assignment</b><p>You can select how you want to assign IPv6 address to the devices on the LAN (i.e. your home network). You can use either the &quot;DHCP Server&quot; or &quot;Auto Config&quot; to assign IPv6 address. Using DHCP Server may pass more information to LAN devices, but some IPv6 systems may not support the DHCv6 client function. &quot;Auto Config&quot; is used by default.<p><b>Use This Interface ID</b><p>You can enable this option and specify the interface ID you want for the IPv6 address for the router's LAN interface. If you don't specify an ID here, the router will generate one automatically from its MAC address.</body>";
