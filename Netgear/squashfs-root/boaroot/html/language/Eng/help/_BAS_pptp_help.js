If you need to enter login information every time you connect to the Internet or you have a PPPoE/PPTP/L2TP account with your ISP, click <b>Yes</b>. Otherwise, click <b>No</b>. </p><p><b>Note: </b>If you have installed PPP software such as WinPoET (from Earthlink) or Enternet (from PacBell), then you have PPPoE. Select <b>Yes</b>. After selecting Yes and configuring your router, you will not need to run the PPP software on your PC to connect to the Internet. </p><a name=isp></a><h2 class=helpfile>Internet Service Provider</h2><p>Select the service provided by your ISP. <b>PPPoE</b> is the most common. <b>PPTP</b> is used in Austria and other European countries. <b>L2TP</b> is used in Russia, Israel, and not common in other countries.</p><a name=login></a><h2 class=helpfile>Login </h2><p>This is usually the name that you use in your e-mail address. For example, if your main mail account isJerAB@ISP.com, then put JerAB in this field. </p><p>Some ISPs (like Mindspring, Earthlink, and T-DSL) require that you use your full e-mail address when you log in. If your ISP requires your full e-mail address, then type it in the <b>Login</b> field. </p><a name=password></a><h2 class=helpfile>Password</h2><p>Type the password that you use to log in to your ISP. </p><a name=conn_mode></a><h2 class=helpfile>Connection Mode</h2><p>Set the Connection Mode to Dial on Demand, Always On, or Manually Connect.<br>With the default setting, Dial on Demand, a PPPoE/PPTPL2TP connection automatically starts when there is outbound traffic to the Internet, and it automatically terminates if the connection is idle based on the value in the Idle Timeout setting.When the Connection Mode is set to Always On, the PPPoE/PPTP/L2TP connection automatically starts when the computer boots up, but the connection does not time out. The router will keep trying to bring up the connection if it is disconnected for some reason.If you select Manually Connect, you must go to the Router Status screen and click the Connect button in order to connect to the Internet. The manual connection does not time out and you have to click the Disconnect button on the Router Status screen to disconnect it.</p><a name=idletime></a><h2 class=helpfile>Idle Time-out</h2><p>An idle Internet connection will be terminated after this time period.<p>If this value is zero (0), then the connection will be kept alive ,the connection will be reestablished immediately whenever the connection is lost.</p><a name=24hreset></a><h2 class=helpfile>Enable automatic internet connection reset at</h2><p>Select this check box to set the specific time that the router will automatically reset the Internet connection.

You need to enter the gateway IP address here. If you use DHCP client to get My IP Address, or your service provider requires you to leave <b>My IP Address</b> blank, there is no need to enter a gateway IP address. </p><a name=id></a><h2 class=helpfile>Connection ID/Name</h2><p>Most of the time the <b>ID/Name</b> field should be left blank. However, if your ISP provided you one, enter the connection ID here.</p><a name=DNSaddress></a><h2 class=helpfile>Domain Name Server (DNS) Address </h2><p>The DNS server is used to look up site addresses based on their names. </p><p>If your ISP gave you one or two DNS addresses, select <b>Use These DNS Servers</b>, and type the primary and secondary addresses. </p><p>Otherwise, select <b>Get Automatically from ISP</b>. </p><p><b>Note: </b>If you get Address not found errors when you go to a website, it is likely that your DNS servers are not set up correctly.
