You can also invite family members or friends to access it.</p><p><b>How to Set Up ReadySHARE Cloud</b></p><p>Step 1: You need a ReadySHARE Cloud account. If you do not have one, click the link provided in this page to go to NETGEAR ReadySHARE Cloud page to create an account. <br/>You'll be asked to enter a valid email address which will be used to recover your user name or password.<br/>Step 2: After Step 1, you need to come back to this router web page, and enter your ReadySHARE Cloud user name and password to register your router and the USB device that is connected to it.<br/>This registration step has to be initiated from your NETGEAR router, meaning you can't register your router through the NETGEAR ReadySHARE Cloud web site <a target='_blank' href='http://readyshare.netgear.com' >http://readyshare.netgear.com</a>.<br/>Step 3: Log back into <a target='_blank' href='http://readyshare.netgear.com' >http://readyshare.netgear.com</a> with your account. You should see the USB device that is connected to your router. By default, all the contents of the USB device are accessible. You can create a new share that is limited to any subset of the contents with the security level you specify.<br/>Step 4: The first time you use ReadySHARE Cloud, you are asked to download a Windows client, which is used to make a secure connection from your PC to the router's USB device. Log into this client and you can access the USB device from anywhere.<br/>Currently you can only download the Windows OS client. The Mac OS client will be ready at a later time on the website.<br/> <b>Note:</b> Without this client, you can only browse your USB device contents by clicking the '+' icon (Add Share) on the website. You won't be able to open files or make changes to them. </p><p><b>User Name and Password</b></p><p>This is the ReadySHARE Cloud account you created on NETGEAR website in step 1.<br/> The router with USB storage will only show up after you register it. The Internet connection between the router and the ReadySHARE Cloud server will be kept alive until you unregister it.<br/> You can also register the router with another account after unregistering it from previous account.<br/></p></BODY>";
