To access the router, you will type your router's WAN IP address into your browser's Address (in IE) or Location (in Netscape) field, followed by a colon (:) and the custom port number. For example, if your external address is 10.0.0.123 and you use port number 8080, enter in your browser:</p> <p><screen>http://10.0.0.123:8080</screen></p><hr><a name=access></a><p><b>Allow Remote Access</b><p> For security, you should restrict access to as few external IP addresses as practical. <p><ul>Select <b>Only This Computer</b> to allow access by only one IP address.</ul><p><ul>Select <b>IP Address Range</b> to allow access from a range of IP addresses on the Internet. Enter a beginning and ending IP address to define the allowed range.</ul><p><ul>Select <b>Everyone</b> to allow access by everyone on the Internet.</ul><hr><a name=port></a><p><b>Port Number</b></p><p>Web browser access usually uses the standard HTTP service port 80. For greater security, you can change the remote management Web interface to a custom port by entering that number in the field provided. Choose a number between 1024 and 65534, but do not use the number of any common service port.</p><hr> <p><b>To save or cancel changes:</b></p><a name=To></a><p>Click <b>Apply</b> to have your changes take effect.<br> Click <b>Cancel</b> to return to the previous settings.</p></body>";
