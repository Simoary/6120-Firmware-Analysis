Unless you are certain that this is what your service provide asks you to set and your ISP has provided you the detailed IPv6 address configurations.<p><b>(WAN Setup) IPv6 Address/Prefix Length</b><p>This specifies the IPv6 address and prefix length of the router's WAN interface.<p><b>Default IPv6 Gateway</b><p>This specifies the IPv6 address of the default IPv6 gateway, which is supposed to be on the router's WAN interface.<p><b>Primary/Secondary DNS Server</b><p>These specify the DNS servers that will resolve IPv6 domain name records for you. If these fields are not specified, the router will use the DNS server(s) configured for the IPv4 Internet connection (on the Basic Settings page).<p><b>IP Address Assignment</b><p>You can select how you want to assign IPv6 address to the devices on the LAN (i.e. your home network). You can use either the &quot;DHCP Server&quot; or &quot;Auto Config&quot; to assign IPv6 address. Using DHCP Server may pass more information to LAN devices, but some IPv6 systems may not support the DHCv6 client function. &quot;Auto Config&quot; is used by default.<p><b>(LAN Setup) IPv6 Address/Prefix Length</b><p>This specifies the IPv6 address and prefix length of the router's LAN interface.</body>";
