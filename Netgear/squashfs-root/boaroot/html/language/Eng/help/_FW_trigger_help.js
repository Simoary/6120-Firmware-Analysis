Port forwarding can typically be used to enable similar functionality, but it is static and has some limitations. </p><p>Port triggering opens an incoming port temporarily and does not require the server on the Internet to track your IP address if it is changed by DHCP, for example. </p><p>Port triggering monitors outbound traffic. When the router detects traffic on the specified outbound port, it remembers the IP address of the computer that sent the data and triggers the incoming port. Incoming traffic on the triggered port is then forwarded to the triggering computer.</p><p><a name=select></a>Using the Port Forwarding / Port Triggering screen, you can make local computers or servers available to the Internet for different services (for example, FTP or HTTP), to play Internet games (like Quake III), or to use Internet applications (like CU-SeeMe).</p><p>Port forwarding is designed for FTP, Web server, or other server-based services. Once port forwarding is set up, requests from the Internet are forwarded to the proper server. </p><p>Port triggering allows requests from the Internet only after a designated port is triggered. Port triggering applies to chat and Internet games.</p><hr><p><b>Port Triggering</b></p><p>Note: If <b>Disable Port Triggering box</b> is checked, <b>all</b> port triggering function will be disabled but the configuration information will remain in the router.</p><p><a name=\"pt_timeout\"></a><b>Port Triggering Timeout</b></p><p>Enter a value up to 9999 minutes.
