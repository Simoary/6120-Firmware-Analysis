WMM allows wireless traffic to have a range of priorities, depending on the kind of data. Time-dependent information, like video or audio, has a higher priority than normal traffic. For WMM to function correctly, wireless clients must also support WMM.<hr><p><a name=\"qos_on\"></a><b>Enable Upstream QoS</b><p> If this feature is enabled, the QoS function prioritizes outgoing traffic to the Internet. For applications, online gaming, an Ethernet LAN port, or a specified MAC address that already exists in the drop-down list, you can modify the priority level by clicking the <b>Edit</b> button. You can click the <b>Delete</b> button to erase the priority rule. You can also define the priority policy for each online game, application, LAN port, or the computer's MAC address by clicking the <b>Add Priority Rule</b> button.</P><p>You have to setup the <b>Maximum Uplink Bandwidth</b> in order to get this QoS function to work. If you don't know the maximum uplink bandwidth for your Internet connection, you can follow the URL here to go to the speedtest.net website. On the Speedtest website, you can run tests to check the maximum upload speed for your Internet connection. Please make sure you run the test on a computer with a wired connection to the router or the computer's wireless connection to the router is higher than your Internet connection. <hr><p><b>For Applications or Online Gaming</b><p>To set up the priority for an application or online gaming: <ul>1.
