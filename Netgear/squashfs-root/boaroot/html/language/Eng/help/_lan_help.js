You can see this name for the router in Network Explorer on Windows Vista systems and the Network Explorer on all Windows systems.</p><hr><a name=tcp></a><p><b>LAN TCP/IP Setup</b></p><p>These are advanced settings that you can configure if you are a network administrator and your network contains multiple routers. If you make any changes to these settings, you will need to restart your computers for the settings to take effect.</p><ul><li><B>IP Address</B>. Type the IP address of your router in dotted decimal notation (factory default: 192.168.1.1).<li><b>IP Subnet Mask</B>. The subnet mask specifies the network number portion of an IP address. Your router will automatically calculate the subnet mask based on the IP address that you assign. Unless you are implementing subnetting, use 255.255.255.0 as the subnet mask (computed by the router).</ul><ul><li><b>RIP Direction:</B> RIP (Routing Information Protocol, RFC1058 and RFC1389) allows a router to exchange routing information with other routers. The RIP Direction selection controls how the router sends and receives RIP packets. Both is the default.<ul><li>When set to <b>Both</b> or <b>Out Only</b>, the router will broadcast its routing table periodically. <li>When set to <b>Both</b> or <b>In Only</b>, it will incorporate the RIP information that it receives. </ul><li><b>RIP<li><b>RIP Version:</B> This controls the format and the broadcasting method of the RIP packets that the router sends. (It recognizes both formats when receiving.) By default, this is set for Disabled.<ul><li>RIP-1 is universally supported. RIP-1 is probably adequate for most networks, unless you have an unusual network setup. <li>RIP-2 carries more information. Both RIP-2B and RIP-2M send the routing data in RIP-2 format. <UL> <li>RIP-2B uses subnet broadcasting.  <li>RIP-2M uses multicasting. (See note below.) </ul> </ul></ul><p><b>Note: </b>Multicasting can reduce the load on non-router machines because they do not listen to the RIP multicast address and will not receive the RIP packets. However, if one router uses multicasting, then all routers on your network must use multicasting. </p><hr><a name=dhcp></a><p><b>Use Router As DHCP Server</b></p><p>The router is set up by default as a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server, which provides the TCP/IP configuration for all the computers that are connected to the router.  <p> Unless told to change these settings by your ISP, leave the <b>Use Router As DHCP Server</b> check box selected.  <p> If your ISP has you clear this check box, you must have another DHCP server within your network, or else you must manually configure the computer.   <ul><li><B>Starting IP Address</B>. This field specifies the first of the contiguous addresses in the IP address pool. 192.168.1.2 is the default start address. <li><b>Ending IP Address</b>. This field specifies the last of the contiguous addresses in the IP address pool. 192.168.1.254 is the default ending address.</ul><hr><a name=reserved></a><p><b>Address Reservation</b></p><p>When you specify a reserved IP address for a PC on the LAN, that PC will always receive the same IP address each time it accesses the DHCP server. Reserved IP addresses should be assigned to servers that require permanent IP settings.<p><b>To reserve an IP address:</b> <ol><li> Click the <b>Add</b> button. <li> Select the radio button of the computer you wish to add from the Address Reservation Table.<li> If the computer is not on the Address Reservation Table, enter the IP address, MAC address, and device name of the computer you wish to add.<li> Click the <B>Add</b> button when finished.</ol><br><p><b>To edit a reserved IP address:</b> </p><ol><li> Select the radio button next to the reserved address you want to edit.<li> Click the <b>Edit</b> button.<li> Edit the IP address, MAC address, or device name.<li> Click the <B>Accept</b> button when finished.</ol><p><b>To delete a reserved IP address:</b> </p><ol><li> Select the radio button next to the reserved address you want to delete.<li> Click the <b>Delete</b> button. </ol><hr><a name=To></a><p><b>To save or cancel changes:</b></p><p>Click <b>Apply</b> to save the new settings to the router. <br>Click <b>Cancel</b> to discard any unsaved changes. </p></body>";
