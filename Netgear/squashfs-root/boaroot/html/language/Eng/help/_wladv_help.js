Do not alter these settings unless directed by NETGEAR support. Incorrect settings might disable the wireless router unexpectedly.<HR><A name=settings></A><P><B>Wireless Router Settings</B></P><P>Enable Wireless Router Radio <P>The wireless access point of this router can be enabled or disabled to allow wireless access. The Wireless LED on the front of the router will also display the current status of the wireless access point to let you know if it is disabled or enabled. If it is enabled, wireless stations will be able to access the Internet. If it is disabled, wireless stations will not be able to access the Internet.</P><P>Enable 20/40 MHz Coexistence</P><P>Disabling this option allows your 2.4GHz wireless to stay in supporting the max speed. Enabling this option may reduce the max speed of your 2.4GHz wireless to the half when there is another wireless network detected in your environment; this is to avoid inteference between wireless networks and to get along with other wireless networks in the environment.</P><P>Fragmentation Threshold, CTS/RTS Threshold, Preamble Mode<P>These settings are reserved for wireless testing and advanced configuration only. Do not change these settings.</P><p>Transmit Power Control<p>The 100% means this router uses the original transmit power setting to transmit wireless packets. Reduce the transmit power level can save power consumption of this device if wireless radio is on, however, it also reduces the wireless coverage. If you want to have whole home coverage, NETGEAR recommend you leave it 100%.</p><HR><A name=wps></A><P><B>WPS Settings</B></P><p>Router's PIN</p><p>This is the PIN number you use on a registrar (e.g., from Network Explorer on Windows 7) to configure the router's wireless settings through WPS.

Enabling this protection option can disable the router's PIN automatically when the router detects a suspicious brute force attack. Once the router's PIN is disabled automatically, it remains disabled until the router reboots or you can manually enable the router's PIN by checking the Enable Router's PIN check box and clicking the <b>Apply</b> button.<br>When the protection is enabled, you can configure the number of accumulated failed attempts that is allowed before the router's PIN is disabled automatically.</p><p>Keep Existing Wireless Settings</p> <P>This shows whether the router is in the WPS configured state.<br>If this option is not selected, adding a new wireless client will change the router's wireless settings to an automatically generated random SSID and security key. In addition, if this option is selected, some external registrars (e.g., Network Explorer on Windows 7) might not see the router.<br>Configuring basic wireless settings from the router's management GUI selects this option automatically.</P><HR><A name=access></A><P><B>Wireless Card Access List</B></P><P>By default, any wireless PC that is configured with the correct SSID will be allowed access to your wireless network.
