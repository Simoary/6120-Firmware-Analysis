If your ISP provides the address of its own relay router, you can put it here. You can also leave it as &quot;Auto&quot; and the router will use anyone that is available. Note that the &quot;6to4 Tunnel&quot; connection needs the IPv4 Internet connection to be up first.<p><b>Router's IPv6 Address on LAN</b><p>This shows the IPv6 address acquired for the router's LAN interface. The number after the slash ('/') is the length of the prefix, which is also roughly indicated by the underline ('_') under the IPv6 address.<p><b>IP Address Assignment</b><p>You can select how you want to assign IPv6 address to the devices on the LAN (i.e. your home network). You can use either the &quot;DHCP Server&quot; or &quot;Auto Config&quot; to assign IPv6 address. Using DHCP Server may pass more information to LAN devices, but some IPv6 systems may not support the DHCv6 client function. &quot;Auto Config&quot; is used by default.<p><b>Use This Interface ID</b><p>You can enable this option and specify the interface ID you want for the IPv6 address for the router's LAN interface. If you don't specify an ID here, the router will generate one automatically from its MAC address.</body>";
