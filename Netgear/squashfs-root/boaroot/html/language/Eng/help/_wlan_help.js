For best results, place your router:<UL><LI>Near the center of the area in which your PCs will operate.<LI>In an elevated location such as a high shelf.<LI>Away from potential sources of interference, such as PCs, microwave ovens, and cordless phones.<LI>Away from large metal surfaces. </LI></UL><P><B>Note:</B> Failure to follow these guidelines can result in significant performance degradation or inability to wirelessly connect to the router.</P><HR><A name=network></A><P><B>Wireless Network</B></P><P>Enable SSID Broadcast<P>If this feature is enabled, the wireless router will broadcast its name (SSID) to all wireless stations. Stations that have no SSID (or a null value) can then adopt the correct SSID for connections to this access point.</P><p>Enable Video Network<p>(For 5GHz a/n network only) Select this check box if you will be streaming HD video. When this option is selected, the router uses Video reliability algorithms to reduce jitter and packet loss during video presentations. If you will not be streaming video, leave this check box unchecked.</p><P>Name (SSID)<P>Enter a value of up to 32 alphanumeric characters. The same name (SSID) must be assigned to all wireless devices in your network. The default SSID is NETGEAR, but NETGEAR strongly recommends that you change your network's name (SSID) to a different value. This value is case-sensitive. For example, NETGEAR is not the same as NETGEAr.<P>Region<P>Select your region from the drop-down list. This field displays the region of operation for which the wireless interface is intended. It might not be legal to operate the router in a region other than the region shown here. If your country or region is not listed, please check with your local government agency or check the NETGEAR website for more information about which channels to use.<P>Channel<P>This field determines which operating frequency will be used. It should not be necessary to change the wireless channel unless you notice interference problems with another nearby access point.</P>";
