# Security Analysis of Router Firmware
This project will introduce the concept of firmware vulnerability analysis (Dynamic and Static). Post which, ten (Mentioned in document as seven, but three more have been added in the new update) selected firmware will be analyzed for vulnerability and the results of vulnerability analysis will be shared. The project also conducts static analysis on selected number of firmware files and shows the statistics of the findings of this analysis. The project also goes out of scope to fix a stated firmware analysis tool for future use.

- Analysed multiple router firmwares and exploited 10 different firmware files using services such as firmadyne.
- Evaluated the severity of the exploits by demonstrating how the exploits were done and how easy is it to do them in real life using penetration testing, exploit frameworks, code review and social engineering simulations.
- Provided and demonstrated solutions to certain exploits.
