Description:  Vorbis is a general purpose audio and music encoding format
 contemporary to MPEG-4's AAC and TwinVQ, the next generation beyond
 MPEG audio layer 3. Unlike the MPEG sponsored formats (and other
 proprietary formats such as RealAudio G2 and Windows' flavor of the
 month), the Vorbis CODEC specification belongs to the public domain.
 All the technical details are published and documented, and any
 software entity may make full use of the format without license
 fee, royalty or patent concerns.
